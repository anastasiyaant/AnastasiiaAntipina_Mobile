1.Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device in mobile cloud. Run test with your changes.
Did test pass?
Yes.


3.	 Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
Yes, if appManager installed on device.

4.	Try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before instead of appPackage and appActivity. Does this approach work?

No, because Epam MobileCloud native tests required appPackage and appActivity capabilities. So, I get an error:
org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException:
 {"status":13,
    "value":
    {"message":
    "An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command.
       Original error: The desired capabilities must include either an app, appPackage or browserName"},
    "sessionId":null}

8. I think it's possible to use Page Objects, but in this homework we used a few webElements, so it's not necessary.
Also maybe it will be good to get all properties from file and make our key encrypted but our project is for study and
we can do it without it.
